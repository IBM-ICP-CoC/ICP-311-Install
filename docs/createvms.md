# Create the Virtual Machines

Provision 5 virtual machines with this configuration:

- RHEL Minimal (7.x)
- 8 CPU / 16GÂ  Mem
- 100GB Boot Disk
- 200GB Disk 1
- 500GB Disk 2

!!! tip
    You can create all 5 VMs at the same time with the same configuration by using the `Quantity` field on the order page.


!!! important
    There are two scripts that will help you prapare your virtual machines for installation of ICP.  
    [modify_fs_v2.sh](files/modify_fs_v2.sh) will prepare the disks and move the `/var` and `/opt` directories to the two additional disks provisioned when the VMs were created.  
    [install_prereqs.sh](files/install_prereqs.sh) takes care of installing MOST of what you will need for the prerequisites.
