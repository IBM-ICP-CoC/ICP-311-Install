Important There are two scripts that will help you prapare your virtual machines for installation of ICP. modify_fs_v2.sh will prepare the disks and move the /var and /opt directories to the two additional disks provisioned when the VMs were created. install_prereqs.sh takes care of installing MOST of what you will need for the prerequisites. When your machines are provisioned it will be helpful for you to collect some information together that you will need later. The table below is an example of what you should collect. The hostnames can be whatever values you want. The passwords are for the root user and can be obtained on the Passwords tab of the Details page for your device.
