To create virtual machines: Login to your IBM Cloud account. Click the Create Resource button on the Dashboard page Click the Virtual Server tile. Specify the following settings for your Virtual Server Instance: The Public Virtual Server tile should be selected; click Continue . Choose Public as the type of virtual server Set the Quantity to 5 Specify values for Host Name and Domain Choose the location and data center of your choice Choose the Balanced B1.8x16 profile. You many need to choose the All Profiles tab to find it. Choose Red Hat as the Image (take the default 7.x Minimal (64-bit) - HVM ). Make sure you actually cick the Red Hat box and that it has a blue outline and the blue checkmark. In the Attached Storage Disks section, click the Add New button twice to create two new disks, named Disk 1 and Disk 2 change the size of the disks: Boot Disk to 100 GB Disk 1 to 200 GB Disk 2 to 500 GB When finished the screen should look like this: Danger Do we need to choose a private VLAN to ensure that all of the machines can talk to each other? DAW Click the checkbox to acknowledge that you have read and agree to the third party agreements and click Create . Note These values for host name and domain do not have any affect on the actual host name and domain defined inside the virtual machines. They are just labels and can be changed at any time. Important There are two scripts that will help you prapare your virtual machines for installation of ICP. modify_fs_v2.sh will prepare the disks and move the /var and /opt directories to the two additional disks provisioned when the VMs were created. install_prereqs.sh takes care of installing MOST of what you will need for the prerequisites. Note When you chose a quantity greater than 1 your virtual machines may have an added sequence number in their host names. Don't forget that you can change the names of your virtual machines after they are created. When your machines are provisioned it will be helpful for you to collect some information together that you will need later. The table below is an example of what you should collect. The hostnames can be whatever values you want. The passwords are for the root user and can be obtained on the Passwords tab of the Details page for your device.
